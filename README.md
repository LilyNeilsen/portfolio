# Portfolio

This is my public portfolio for my Telling Stories with Data course that I'm taking in Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University

# About me 
My name is Lily Neilsen and I am a graduate student in the Master of Science in Public Policy and Management (MSPPM) program at Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently working for a non-profit organization as part of a fellowship in addition to a startup called NeptuneChain, which I co-founded.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn more about how I can use this in government work, and if and how it is already being used at local, state, federal, and international levels of government.


# Some of the work I did during this course:

# Assignment 3

# Assignment 4

# Final Project
